# AmaTickets
#### By: Juan Manuel Amador Roa


## Extra features:
- Now the Event is in a Calendar (so event now is not a document and is part of the calendar)
- The calendar has a banner and a main image, title and description (in the UI the calendar has tags but those tags are calculated using each event)
- There are tags in each Event that shows extra information about the event itself, they can be stylized with the color and textColor attributes. And the administrator can add/update/delete any tag of an event
- Tag has: text, textColor and color
- QR for each order detail, all of these would be sent to client email at pay section (may be scanned to add event in the device calendar default app, like google calendar). And you can add a recordatory in your app for this event
- Filtering by a tag when filtering events
- A user can have at most 3 carts (random functionality)
